    <faq id="faq001">
      <question>
        What does the channel represent in the config file?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The channel that you configure in the config file is then used in the scenario. If you configured "channel-1" in your config file, you will use "<![CDATA[<send channel="channel-1">]]>" in your scenario.

      <question>
        How do we define random holding times?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          This is not possible. You will have to run several Seagull in parallel for that. I will see what we can do for a future release.

      <question>
        How does Seagull work - in 3 lines?
      </question>
      <answer>
          	<ul>
            <li>A traffic scenario (sequence of send/receive/wait-ms) is defined.</li>
            <li>The traffic scenario is multiplied, following the "call-rate" instruction. 100 calls/second call rate will start 100 parallel scenarios for each second.</li>
            <li>Other kind of scenarios (init, default, abort) can also be defined. Those scenarios are not "multiplied" following the call rate. See doc for more details on those.</li>
            </ul>
      </answer>
    </faq>
    <faq id="faq004">
      <question>
       What happens if a call is stuck?
      </question>
      <answer>
          	<p>By default, the call will be stuck forever. You activate the call-timeout to instruct Seagull to close "hang" calls.
            If a call is active beyond the call-timeout-ms value, the call will time out and Seagull will close the call by using the <![CDATA[<abort>]]> section
            of the scenario if it exists.</p>

    <faq id="faq005">
      <question>
       Is Seagull stable?
      </question>
      <answer>
          	<p>Yes, Seagull runs and runs. Judge for yourself:</p>
