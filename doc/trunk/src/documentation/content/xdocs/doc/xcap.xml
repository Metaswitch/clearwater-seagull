      <title>XCAP protocol details</title>
      <p>The implementation of XCAP in Seagull conforms to <a href="http://www.jdrosen.net/papers/draft-ietf-simple-xcap-11.txt">draft-ietf-simple-xcap-11.txt</a> 
      (see also <a href="http://www.jdrosen.net/simple_acap.html">http://www.jdrosen.net/simple_acap.html</a>).
      XCAP being a text payload (transported by HTTP), Seagull does not really describe 
      the XCAP protocol in its dictionary. Instead, XCAP messages and parameters
      are described using "CDATA" XML tags which gives a great flexibility
      to add messages and parameters in the scenarios.</p>

      <title>Getting started with XCAP</title>
      <section>
        <title>First try</title>
        <p>So that you can get familiar with Seagull in the context of XCAP, 
        here is an example that will launch one XCAP server 
        (a server expects a message as the first scenario command) and one XCAP
        client (a client sends a message as the first scenario command). 
        The client and the server will talk to each other using the loopback interface 
        (127.0.0.1). The scenario is the following:</p>
        <source><![CDATA[          PUT     
     |------------>|
     | 201 Created |
     |<------------|
     |   DELETE    |
     |------------>|
     |   200 OK    |
     |<------------|]]></source>
        <p>Here is the XML source of the <a href="xcap.client.xml.html">client scenario</a>.</p>

An XCAP call is identified by the channel on which protocol exchanges occur.
This action is to open a TCP socket for each new XCAP call. This socket is
closed at the end of the call (see below).

An XCAP message as an Header (mandatory) and a body (optional).
Here, Seagull just sends the header as indicated in the CDATA







When the message is sent, the body is separated by the header with
an empty line (\r\n).
An XCAP body must be correctly formated: the top most xml tag (<note>
in this case must be properly closed </note). 
Seagull parses the body to find out where the message ends (this is
needed because content-length header is optional).




The 201 Created message is received on the channel that was opened 
at the beginning of the call.








































The transport channel (TCP socket in this case) is closed at the
end of the call with the <close/ action.

      <p>Generating the XCAP traffic is quite easy with Seagull. Users must
      be aware that some limitations apply with respect to HTTP, on which
      XCAP relies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTTP Digest authentication is not yet supported (but planned)</li>
        <li>HTTP chunked mode might work but has not been tested</li>
        <li>HTTPs is not supported</li>
      </ul>
